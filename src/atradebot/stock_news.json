AAPL stock currently sports a market capitalization of $2.95 trillion.\nThe company recently exceeded the $3 trillion market as it continued to carve out new all-time highs. While the stock has seen some mild profit-taking in recent trading, the action has been robust.\nShares still boast a year-to-date gain of 44%. While that lags many of its FAANG peers, it\u2019s the only component of that group to get back to (and exceed) its prior all-time highs.\nSo why should investors keep an eye on AAPL stock?\nOn Friday, July 14, the Nasdaq 100 will announce the results of its special rebalancing. The rebalance, which will take place before the market open on Monday, July 17, will take place to \u201caddress overconcentration in the index by redistributing the weights.\u201d\nThis is only the third time the Nasdaq will enact a special rebalance. Previously, it did so in December 1998 and May 2011.\nThe Nasdaq 100 is weighted by market cap, so it\u2019s not hard to understand how the scales have tipped in recent years and more specifically, in 2023. In addition to FAANG, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) have appreciated considerably this year.\nWhile much of the market has lagged, these names have been surging to the upside. In fact, the worst performer of this group so far in 2023 is Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), despite sporting a 32.7% year-to-date gain.\nThanks to the current rally, the Nasdaq 100\u2019s top seven holdings \u2014 Apple, Alphabet, Tesla, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta (NASDAQ:META) \u2014 make up 55% of the index. Apple holds the No. 2 weighting at 12.5%, just behind Microsoft\u2019s 12.9% weighting.\nWhat\u2019s Next for AAPL Stock?\nThe rebalancing of the Nasdaq 100 will have an impact on Apple headlines, but ultimately, we\u2019re talking about the largest public company on earth. It plays a role in various U.S.-based indices and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), including the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow Jones Industrial Average.\nThe bigger focus for AAPL stock will likely be earnings, which are due up in a few weeks. Currently, Apple is scheduled to report earnings on Aug. 3 after the market close.\nWith the firm having already provided a product update for investors via its WWDC event in June, earnings are next. Keep in mind, this will be Apple\u2019s fiscal third-quarter results, with its fourth-quarter results due up in the fall.\nAnalysts expect a down year for earnings and revenue this year, but despite that, investors are gobbling up AAPL stock. Next year\u2019s estimates call for growth, so that will soon be the focus assuming the economy can remain on track.\nFor what it\u2019s worth, the Nasdaq 100 does not have a poor track record following its prior rebalances \u2014 although the same size is pretty small.\nWhen it did so in 1998, its six-month and one-year performances were roughly flat and up about 7%, respectively. In 2011, those figures climbed dramatically, to a gain of roughly 28% over the next six months and roughly 100% over the next year.\nOn the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Nonetheless, AAPL shares have rallied about 55% so far this year amid optimism around generative artificial intelligence (AI) and confidence in the tech giant\u2019s ability to continue to grow in the long term. While most Wall Street analysts remain bullish on Apple, the upside in the stock could be limited in the near term due to ongoing macro pressures.\nAnalysts Stay Bullish on AAPL Stock\nApple\u2019s overall revenue declined 3% year-over-year to about $95 billion in the fiscal second quarter (ended April 1, 2023), following a 5% fall in the prior quarter. High inflation and macro pressures have impacted consumers\u2019 wallets, with discretionary spending taking a backseat. Apple expects its June quarter revenue decline rate to be similar to the March quarter.\nDespite the ongoing challenges, Apple\u2019s iPhone business and its Services segment remain resilient. It is worth noting that iPhone revenue increased 1.5% during Q2 FY23, even as the broader smartphone industry sales plunged as per IDC estimates. Revenue from the company\u2019s higher-margin Services business increased 5.5% in Q2 FY23.\nOn Tuesday, KeyBanc analyst Brandon Nispel increased his price target for Apple stock to $200 from $180 and reiterated a Buy rating on the stock. While the analyst\u2019s long-term view is bullish, he told investors that he is neutral on the stock in the near term due to his below-consensus hardware revenue estimates for Q3 FY23.\nThe analyst explained that the excitement around Apple\u2019s new product launches and investors\u2019 preference for safer bets \u201cis resulting in an elevated multiple\u201d for the stock.\nLast week, Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan noted that as per SensorTower data, App Store revenues in Q3 FY23 increased 5.9% year-over-year to $6.6 billion, with total downloads on iPhone and iPad increasing 4.3%. Also, App Store dollars per download grew 1.5% in the fiscal third quarter. Overall Mohan highlighted that App Store trends improved marginally in the June quarter from the March quarter.\nHowever, Mohan continues to have a Hold rating on the stock with a price target of $190 based on risk-reward balance, as positive catalysts related to new product launches (AR/VR headset) and stable iPhone sales are offset by a potentially weaker consumer spending backdrop in the second half of the year.\nIs Apple a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\nWall Street\u2019s Strong Buy consensus rating on AAPL is based on 24 Buys and seven Holds. The average price target of $193.57 implies only 3% upside potential.\nInvestors looking for AAPL\u2019s most accurate and profitable analyst could follow TD Cowen analyst Krish Sankar. Copying the analyst\u2019s trades on this stock and holding each position for one year could result in 96% of your transactions generating a profit, with an average return of 52.4% per trade.\nConclusion\nWhile most Wall Street analysts remain bullish on Apple due to its long-term growth potential backed by production innovation, brand value, and high-margin Services business, the average price target indicates limited upside due to the impact of macro pressures on the tech giant\u2019s business.", "stock": "AAPL"}, {"link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tata-group-inches-closer-becoming-180507779.html", "title": "Tata Group Inches Closer To Becoming India's First iPhone Maker", "snippet": "This story was first published on the Benzinga India portal.

The result missed our expectations due to a lower revenue.\n- Apple unveiled an augmented reality headset, Vision Pro, to be released in 2024, with potential revenue from the product expected to total $4 billion in 2024 and rise to $4.8.\n- Demand on the global market of devices remained weak.\nInvestment Thesis\nDemand in the global market of devices remained weak. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) sold 58 mln (-2% y/y) iPhones, 12.4 mln iPads (-17% y/y), 4.4 mln Macs (-38% y/y), and 10 mln Watches (-32% y/y) in 2Q 2023. Markets declined more than we had expected, prompting us to reduce the forecast for 2023 shipments in all segments of Apple's products. We rate the stock a sell.\nSmartphones Market\nThe global market of smartphones has fallen for a fifth straight quarter. The total smartphone shipments dropped by 13% y/y in 1Q 2023 (2Q 2023 of Apple's fiscal year).\nFalling real incomes and the weak recovery of demand in China have prompted the downward trend in the smartphone market to continue. The poor stratum of the population has been hit the hardest by high inflation, which is the reason why the biggest decline in sales was observed in the segment of cheap smartphones. It didn't help that sweeping advertising campaigns were launched touting discounts, so that retailers could destock (sell off their inventories). It is expected that total smartphone inventories will return to a healthy level in the next few quarters.\nApple sold about 58 mln iPhones (-2% y/y), more than anyone else in the industry thanks to its exposure to middle and high-income audience. Apple's share of the entire market climbed to 21% (+3 pp y/y) in 1Q 2023. The market share of its key rivals - Samsung and Xiaomi - slid to 22% (-2 pp y/y) and 11% (-2 pp y/y), respectively.\nAs weak demand is putting a greater pressure on the smartphones market than expected, we are lowering the forecast for total smartphone sales in 2023 from 1220.4 mln units (+2.3% y/y) to 1193.2 mln units (+0% y/y), with the recovery accelerating toward 4Q 2023. We are also lowering the forecast for 2024 from 1290 mln units (+5.7% y/y) to 1224 mln units (+2.6% y/y) as the effect of inventory normalization is being pushed back.\nAs a result, we are lowering the forecast for iPhone shipments in 2023 from 245 mln units (-0.4% y/y) to 232 mln units (-5.7% y/y).\niPad Segment\nThe tablet market was down 18% y/y in 1Q 2023. For the most part, the tablet market declined for the same reasons as the smartphone market. The only exception was the holiday period in 4Q 2022, when tablet manufacturers offered massive discounts, which helped to keep the market afloat, with a growth of 1% y/y in that period. In the smartphone market, massive discounts came from dealers in 1Q 2023, in order to achieve a healthier level of inventories.\nApple retained its leadership in the tablet market in 1Q 2023, selling 12.3 mln devices (-17% y/y), which made up 38.9% of the market (+0.3 pp y/y). Apple's competition in this market is Samsung with a 21.2% market share (+0.8 pp y/y) and Amazon with a 7.9% market share (-1.4 pp y/y).\nGiven a steeper decline in the tablet market than we expected, we are lowering our forecast for iPad sales from 70.5 mln units (+11% y/y) to 59.7 mln units (-5.6% y/y) for 2023, and from 75.8 mln units (+7.5% y/y) tp 62.5 mln units (+4.6% y/y) for 2024.\nMac Segment\nTotal PC shipments fell by 28% y/y in 1Q 2023 due to declining real incomes and sweeping corporate layoffs. Apple showed one of the worst performances in the sector. Sales of Macs fell to 4.4 mln units (-38% y/y). The stronger drop, compared with the rest of the sector, is attributable to the longer life cycle of Apple's devices, which means more time elapses before Apple devices are replaced, compared with the competition.\nDue to the stronger pressure that's exerted on Apple's sales by the market's macro environment, we are lowering the forecast for Mac sales from 29.8 mln units (+4.2% y/y) to 23.9 mln units (-16% y/y) for 2023, and from 31.3 mln units (+5% y/y) to 24.4 mln units (+2% y/y) for 2024.\nFor the iPad and Mac segment as a whole, we had expected a positive y/y sales performance in 2023, due to the superiority of Apple devices in their niches and the release of even more powerful devices, similar to the performance on the smartphone market. But our expectations have not materialized and Apple's sales in these markets are the closest to the performance of its competition. Additional pressure on the PC and tablet markets comes from the weak recovery in China, which is the largest consumer of devices.\nApple Vision Pro\nAt its Worldwide Developers Conference on June 5, Apple unveiled an augmented reality headset, which the company plans to release at the start of 2024 (tentatively, in 2Q of Apple's fiscal year 2024).\nAccording to Statista, the global market of AR headsets will total $2.36 bln (+127% y/y) in 2023, and the market of AR software $11.58 bln (+10% y/y). The potential value of the AR&VR market is estimated to total $52 bln by 2027 (meaning a CAGR of +14% y/y).\nTwo key things to note about Vision Pro are that it's the first new product from Apple after the release of the Apple Watch more than 10 years ago; and that the price of the new gadget will be $3499, which is significantly more expensive, compared to the competition in both the AR and VR segments.\nApple's headset will run on its own operating system called visionOS, which is the world's first spatial OS. The proprietary OS allows the user to interact with digital content without using controllers (an important difference from the alternatives). Instead, the OS responds to natural user movements (eye and hand movements, and voice commands). The headset also supports ultra-high-resolution displays with 23 million pixels, which is significantly more than existing devices have.\nThe main rival product on the market is Meta Quest Pro, which offers a similar option to switch between virtual and mixed realities. Meta Quest Pro has been on the market since 2022, selling at $999 and offering access to the entire Oculus ecosystem.\nThe market of AR/VR headsets is fairly young and unstable from the perspective of its participants. It has fairly long been dominated, almost exclusively, by Meta's Oculus, which aggregated more than 80% of the market in 4Q 2022. Sony PSVR 2 came to market in February 2023, grabbing 35.9% of the total VR/AR headset market over a little less than 1 \u00bd months. Oculus headsets continued to dominate, but their share slumped from 81% of the market to 47.8% over the first quarter.\nThe VR/AR market has declined by 54.4% y/y in terms of units, with the drop mostly affecting VR headsets. If we single out AR headsets alone, this segment expanded by 12% y/y due to products released by Xreal, a player confined to an extremely small niche.\nSony, which has just returned to the market, has quickly enough won back attention in the VR/AR market, which only reaffirms that the market is in the early phase of user interest. Therefore, when analyzing Apple's potential performance, the focus should be on sales in terms of units. Especially since Apple is not competing with Oculus and Sony for the best price, with those companies offering their devices at $599 to $999 depending on the model.\nApple expects it will sell about 1 mln headsets in 2024 (compared with the total of 8.8 mln headsets that were sold in 2022). Different analysts have quite a wide range of estimates for potential sales. KGI Securities believes that Apple will sell only 200 thousand units, while CS analysts expect sales of more than 1 mln units. If the company manages to sell 1 mln units in 2024, that would bring in about $3.5 bln in revenue from the gadget sales alone.\nIt's worth bearing in mind that the Vision Pro will be built into Apple's wider product ecosystem, and most of the projected AR market for 2024 is made up by advertising and software sales (total gadget sales will account for only $4.4 bln of $22 bln).\nAs a result, Apple could earn not only the $3.5 bln in revenue from gadget sales but also about $500 mln in average fees from software companies that operate using Apple infrastructure.\nWe do not expect Apple to dominate the general VR/AR device market as it does the smartphone market, where the company has a 20% market share in terms of units and 80% in terms of profit. That's because the market is now shaped by major players with their own developed ecosystems: Oculus and Sony\nThe bottom line is that we expect revenue from the product to total $4 bln in 2024 and rise to $4.8 bln in 2025.\nEBITDA from the product, including services - assuming Apple products have an average margin of 35%, and Apple services have an average margin of 70% - could reach $1.6 bln in 2024 and $1.9 bln in 2025.\nRevenue and EBITDA from Vision Pro will make up about 1% of the company's total revenue.\nApple's Financial Results\nDue to the downward revision of the performance of the main device markets where Apple has a presence, and as we add revenue from Vision Pro, we are lowering the revenue forecast from $420.1 bln (+6.5% y/y) to $391 bln (-0.1% y/y) for 2023 and from $465.6 bln (+10.8% y/y) to $428.5 bln (+9.6% y/y) for 2024.\nWe are also lowering the EBITDA forecast from $133.6 bln (+2.3% y/y) to $124.2 bln (-0.5% y/y) for 2023 and from $145.2 bln (+8.7% y/y) to $134.8 bln (+8.5% y/y) for 2024.\nValuation\nAccording to our estimates, the fair value price of the stock is $129. Target price was obtained as the average between the two evaluation methods. Rating is sell.\nConclusion\nApple is a high-tech company that is busy developing its own ecosystem. However, recent trends in the smartphone market significantly limit its growth potential. The current business growth rates do not correspond to such an inflated valuation. We believe the Apple stock rally is coming to an end. Rating is sell.\nThis article was written by\nAnalyst\u2019s Disclosure: I/we have no stock, option or similar derivative position in any of the companies mentioned, and no plans to initiate any such positions within the next 72 hours.

However, the company still has a solid long-term outlook, making it a compelling buy to hold over the next decade.\nHere's why Apple is my top stock to buy right now.\nA stock that won't stop\nThere's been some criticism surrounding Apple's stock rise this year, with analysts pointing to its price-to-earnings ratio of 33, which indicates it's currently overvalued. The concern is well founded, and the company's shares are on the expensive side. However, its high price point further reflects the stability and low volatility of its stock.\nIn the first two quarters of 2023, Apple has reported year-over-year revenue declines of 5% and 3% as it recovers from an economically challenging 2022. Yet investors have continued to trust the long-term prospects of the company, keeping its stock trending up. While many companies might suffer significant stock declines after such earnings results, Wall Street sees Apple's short-term hurdles as investment opportunities.\nThe company's consistency is evident in its five-year stock growth. As seen in the chart above, Apple has enjoyed a significantly higher stock increase since 2018 than any other company in the \"Big Five\" of tech. Apple's focus on delivering high-quality products and services to consumers has granted it immense brand loyalty and allowed its business to continue on a growth path.\nOver the long term, the company's leading market shares in multiple areas of its product lineup suggest it will retain its $3 trillion market cap, with the potential to soar far higher.\nSlowly diversifying its earnings away from the iPhone\nApple's highest-earnings product by far is the iPhone. The smartphone segment regularly earns over 50% of its revenue, and has become a useful tool to attract consumers to its other offerings. However, with so much of Apple's business riding on the iPhone, it can feel risky to dedicate a large amount of your portfolio to the company. But the tech giant is on a path that is gradually allowing it to lean less on iPhone sales.\nIn 2019 Apple made a massive push into digital services with the launch of Apple TV+, Arcade, News+, and Fitness+. The company had already entered the industry with its Music platform in 2015, but the further expansion into subscription-based services has led its related segment to become the second-highest-earning part of its business. What's more, services revenue growth came to 14% last year, double the iPhone's growth.\nMeanwhile, the digital side of the business provides attractive profit margins, with services hitting 72% in 2022. Comparatively, product profit margins came to 36% in the same period.\nMoreover, the recent debut of Apple's first virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) headset, the Vision Pro, could further diversify its earnings in the long run. The device has debuted at a starting price of $3,499, pricing out many consumers. However, future iterations of the device could see Apple bring down the price and make it more accessible to the masses. If done right, the Vision Pro has the potential to bolster the company's services business as consumers seek entertainment options for the headset and pave a path for Apple to become the leader of the high-growth VR/AR sector.\nApple is dominating consumer tech, which has allowed it to build a lucrative services business. As it continues to diversify its earnings, the company is easily one of the most reliable long-term investments available. Its P/E may be high, but holding its stock for the next five to ten years will likely offer far higher gains.", "stock": "AAPL"}]
